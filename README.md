# Office tracker app
The simple idea behind this is you want to track who is working from home/in the office and when.

## Install:
**TODO: Make instructions**
When added to the website you'll need to go over to the project and update the default channel for posting general messages in

## Functionality:
- Post messages into a specific channel with actions asking if a user is home or in the office for that day
    - When a user clicks yes/no to the action it will get recorded into the database. Then a message will be sent directly from the app to the user
