# Office tracker app
The simple idea behind this is you want to track who is working from home/in the office and when.

## Tasks:
**Sync users** (`sync-users`): This will sync the users with Slack to find the correct Usernames to send messages to
**Message users** ('message-users`): This will send the question asking the user where they are that day

// Find each user needed for the convo - 
// Send a message to each user =-
// Make the token an env var -
// Get the user email address from the user - 
// Send through the email, state, datetime
// Send data to stich data
